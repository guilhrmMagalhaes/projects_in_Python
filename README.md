# My Python Projects Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is where I store my small Python projects, experiments, and code samples. Feel free to explore the projects and use them for learning or inspiration.

## Project List

Here's a list of the Python projects and code samples in this repository:

1. [Marcador_email_NaoLido_para_Lido]([link-to-project](https://github.com/guilhrmMagalhaes/projects_in_Python/blob/0ee9bd64fd1f1eb7e6a08f2fa8729005e9026571/Marcador_email_NaoLido_para_Lido)): This Python code utilizes the PyAutoGUI library to automate actions in a web browser (Firefox), aiming to access the Gmail inbox and mark emails as read.
2. Tradutor_Excel_NGSL: The code translates words from the 'Lemma' column of the DataFrame from English to Portuguese, adds the translations as a new column, and saves the modified DataFrame to a new Excel file.
